        <h2 id="rules-preparation">PREPARATION</h2>
        <p>
            Each player needs dice (d4, d6, d8, d10, 12, d20), way to note things down; one of the player is the Game Master (GM) who describes the World.
        </p>

        <h2 id="rules-pc">PLAYER CHARACTER</h2>
        <p>
            Player Character (PC) has a Level (LVL); character gains 1 LVL when they manage to Survive; when gaining LVL, can choose to pick one new Skill or pass; character starts at LVL 0 with no Skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            Maximum 5 VITALITY (VIT); when 2 VIT are missing enter Crisis; when 4 VIT are missing the character faints; when all VIT is gone the character dies; all VIT is restored when resting at a Safe Place.
        </p>
        <p>
            Armor Rating (AR) is equal 0; can be increased by equipping armor.
        </p>
        <p>
            Focus Points (FP) can be spent on rolling the dice again (1 FP for one die), adding or subtracting from the result (by 1 for 1 FP), reducing received damage (1 FP for each point of damage) or activating Abilities; all FP are restored when resting at a Safe Place; character at LVL 0 has 3 Max FP, increase by 1 when gaining LVL.
        </p>
        <p>
            When created, a character can have equipment with total value of 100; all unused value is retained in Coins.
        </p>

        <h2 id="rules-attributes">ATTRIBUTES</h2>
        <p>
            Attributes describe the character's limits:</br>
            # STRENGTH (STR) - physical might</br>
            # DEXTERITY (DEX) - nimbleness of the character</br>
            # TOUGHNESS (TGH) - ability to endure</br>
            # KNOWLEDGE (KNW) - knowledge about the world</br>
            # WITS (WTS) - resisting fatigue and fear</br>
            Assign to each one a dice: d12, d10, d8, d6, d4; when making a Check roll that dice; if higher than needed, the Check succeeds
        </p>

        <h2 id="rules-traits">TRAITS</h2>
        <p>
            Create your character's trait; trait should be tied to the character's identity or backstory; when making a Check tied to the PC's trait, roll another die of the same ATR and choose higher number; example traits:</br>
            # construction worker</br>
            # marathon runner</br>
            # programmer</br>
            # oracle</br>
            # singer</br>
            # priest
        </p>

        <h2 id="rules-skills">SKILLS</h2>
        <p>
            Special action or effect for a character; if it has PASSIVE, it's active permanently and reduces Max FP by it's cost; if it has ACTIVE, spend the number of AP to activate it.</br>
            # Bend Voice (ACTIVE 1FP) - manipulate a sound.</br>
            # Blade Master (PASSIVE 2FP) - roll the die twice when Attacking using a melee weapon.</br>
            # Blink (ACTIVE 3FP) - teleport to a close location.</br>
            # Blood Communion (ACTIVE 1FP) - transfer 1 VIT between two a targets for each FP spent; can raise current VIT above Maximum.</br>
            # Danger Sense (PASSIVE 1 FP) - feel nearby hostile creatures.</br>
            # Focused Shot (ACTIVE 3 FP) - ranged attacks gain +1 for this turn; only up to 2 attacks this turn.</br>
            # Iron Flesh (ACTIVE 3FP) - reduce incoming damage to 1; can be used as a reaction.</br>
            # Mind Bullet (ACTIVE 1FP) - deal 1 damage to a target; deal 1 more damage for each additional FP spent.</br>
            # Rage (PASSIVE 1FP) - deal 1 more damage when in Crisis.</br>
            # Second Chance (PASSIVE 3FP) - receiving fatal damage when above Crisis reduces to 1 VIT instead.</br>
            # Shield Bash (PASSIVE 0FP) - shields can be used as 1d4 melee.</br>
            # Summon (ACTIVE 3 FP) - summon a Familiar that can perform simple actions; it has 1 VIT and withers away when resting at a Safe Place.</br>
            # Survivor (PASSIVE 0 FP) - gain 1FP when entering Crisis for the first time after resting at a Safe Place.</br>
            # Swift Strike (PASSIVE 2 FP) - melee weapons used with 1H gain 1 more die when Attacking.</br>
            # Wall of Force (ACTIVE 2 FP) - grant AR+2 to 1 target or AR+1 to 2 targets until your next turn.</br>
            # Quick Draw (ACTIVE 1 FP) - swap out held items and use them immediately
        </p>

        <h2 id="rules-combat">COMBAT</h2>
        <p>
            Characters on the same side take actions after one another during one turn, then it's the other side's turn; every PC can do 1 action:</br>
            # Attack - shoot a gun or swing a melee weapon; roll the dice; if above target's AR deal damage = dice result minus target's AR; if PC has a weapon in other hand, they can use it at the same time.</br>
            # Defend - hide behind cover or guard with a shield; increases AR by 2 until PC's next turn.</br>
            # Use Ability - use one of the PC's Active Abilities.</br>
            # Use Item - use one of the PC's items.</br>
            # Disengage - attempt to flee; roll DEX, WIS or WLP (up to player) against an opponent's DEX, WIS or WLP (up to the GM); if successful, PC escapes Combat.</br>
            # Interact - PC interacts with the World; usually requires a Check to be made.
