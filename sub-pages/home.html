    <h2>What is Heaven Lost?</h2>
    <p>
        Heaven Lost is a Tabletop Roleplaying game made by me. It is made to be simple and easy to get into with little preparation required from the player's side, while still offering a decent amount of variety and growth options for their character.

    <h2>What is the setting of this game?</h2>
    <p>
        Heaven Lost does not have set setting, but when writing it I was thinking of mix between post-apocalyptic and eldritch horror settings. When reading the rules you may notice how most descriptions are laconic and offering little to no context on what it actually means - this is a style choice I made in order to emphasise the feeling of uncertainty. The mechanics of the game are also meant to represent that, with player characters being really vulnerable when not prepared.
